# Documentation

There is no real documentation yet.


.gcode files should only contain the raw position commands in Grbl format. No start and no end commands. Metric system only. 
If there is gcode to change to imperial the code will overwrite it and switch back to metric.
I don't have time to change this at the moment.

The code is not comparable to Grbl. Don't expect anything to work like it does with Grbl.


There are a lot of parameters to adjust the process. Some are available on the front page via the left menu buttons but the most are within the menu that can be opened from the scope.

Touch the top bar of the scope to enter the menu and use the navigation arrows to change pages.
